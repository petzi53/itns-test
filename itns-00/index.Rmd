## Goal of this interactive demo

<img style="float: right; width: 15%"

Here comes text. With this short demo I want to explore possible interactive szenarios for a new edition of [Introduction to the New Statistics: Estimation, Open Science, and Beyond](https://www.routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138825529/default.php) by Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jageman (2017, New York: Routledge) or for short _ITNS_. It is a follow up of the discussion in the  [ITNS-blog](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/2018/10/09/itns-the-second-edition/#comment-99).


This demo uses some of the possibilities offered by the R package [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) in conjunction with the powerfull [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package. But keep in mind that I am not a programmer and still not very skilled in the programming [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the packages mentioned above. My main purpose with this demo is to provide a proof of the concept for the usage of R not only to analyse and visualise complex data sets but also as a tool for learning statistics.

This may sound strange: R is a very complex tool and outside the community already infamous for its steep learning curve. There is no guidance by menues but users have to write code lines and to programme commands for their statistical explorations and analysis. But I think with some care and the right tools there are some educational reason why you should use R especially for introductory courses.

## My educational rationale for learning Statistics

From an educational point of view in teaching Statistics one has to overcome two difficulties at the same time:

1. **Understanding of statistical concepts:** Just to hear or read about concepts is not enough. There should also exercises to explore basic theoretical notions. These types of exercises should be independent of the software one is going to use. Borrowing a term by Donald Schön these tasks are so-called "local experiments". 

Besides of the new content aspects of the _ITNS_ book (changed importance of statistical significance and the integrration of Open Science tools) it also applies educational innovation in using many local experiments. To illustrate what I mean with local experiments two example from the book:

* "If a data point lies exactly on a bin boundary, does ESCI places it in the bin to the left or to the right?
* "With the Laptop data …, what two extra data points could you add without changing the mean or the SD?".

_ITNS_ is using ESCI --- a special Excel programmed software --- for these kinds of inquiries. These exercises are great and are one of the outstanding features of _ITNS_ but they lack connection to a modern statistical software. In my opinion it does not make sense to learn tools expeically provided for learning concepts and later to learn to tranfer this kind of knowledge to real world conditions.

2. **Learning and applying R:** These second types of exercises are tool dependent. One has to know how the R language works, what kind of commands, functions and packages one has to use. Because of an overwhelming complexity R has a steep learning curve which has to be adressed carefully. 

_ITNS_ is using some additional exploratory files for SPSS and R usage. As important these files are, they provide not the required level of detailed instructions for beginners and do not include the above mentioned local exeripemts.

## Target group and learning outcomes

An interactive tutorial written with programm packages of R itself is in my imagination primarily intended for people who work through the _ITNS_ book and want to have more interactive exercises using R. No familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed, but some basic grasp of using computers would be necessary.

The following suggested learning outcomes provide information at the course level. As there are different levels in a curriculum (course, module/chapter lesson/section etc.) with their own learning outcomes, only 3-5 learning outcomes on each level is sufficent. In formulating the following outcomes I am applying the taxonomy by Anderson & Krathwohl (2001, 2002) which is an extended and revised edition of the original taxonomy by Bloom (1956).

<!-- The following is done via bootstrap -->

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  The following learning outcomes are my tentative approximation and has to be adapted/revised/changed by the book authors. 
</div>

Having successfully completed the _ITNS_ book with the planned interactive course you will be able to:

+ explain the differences between the NHST (Null hypothesis significance testing) and the new statistics approach (effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis).
+ to follow the new statistical approach of estimation by using the R programme package.
+ manipulate and transform data with R to bring them in a format suitable for exploratory data analysis
+ create high quality data visualizations with the R package ggplot2
+ apply Open Science procedures in order to foster transparency and reproducibility to your research projects

## Structure of this demonstration

This demonstration does not follow the book outline but takes all the different educational scenarios of the book and tries to translate it into an online presentation with interactive exercises.

Each section starts with a description of the educational structure and purpose of the material found in the book. This is followed by a suggested online presentation and/or interaction. 

On the left side there is a navigation bar with links to the different subsections. The program stores the last state of the learner: The answers and where he stopped the last time. At the bottom there is a tiny "Start Over" button. This is useful to restart the tutorial and commes in very handy to explore different answers possibilities pf this demo.

This demonstration is written in R Markdown and uses the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package in combination with the [`checkr`](https://github.com/dtkaplan/checkr). The source code can be inspected at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/petzi53/itns). 

I have written this tutorial to rebuild my own competences in statistics and at the same time to improve my R skills. As I am not an expert on both subject please help to improve this tutorial via pull requests (PR) at GitHub or [contact me](mailto:peter_baumgartner@me.com) for errors or other improvements.
