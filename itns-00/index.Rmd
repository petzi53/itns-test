# Preface

## Goal of this interactive tutorial

This tutorial contains some supplementary material for [Introduction to the New Statistics: Estimation, Open Science, and Beyond](https://www.routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138825529/default.php) by Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jageman (2017, New York: Routledge) or for short _itns_. In this tutorial I provide some interactive exercises offered in the book above.

Because I am not a statistician therefore is this material not intended as an authoratative guide or qualitative addiitional teaching ressource. My main purpose of this tutorial is to provide a proof of the concept. I want to test the possibilities of the R package `learnr` in conjunction with `shiny` to provide interactive exercises for a better understanding of statistical concepts and some training in using the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) for solving statistical tasks. 

From an educational point of view this material has to overcome two difficulties at the same time:

1. **Understanding of statistical concepts:** These types of exercises should be independent of the software one is going to use. Borrowing a term by Donald Schön these tasks are so-called "local exerpiments". Local exerpiments are for instance: "What happens if a data point lies exactly on a bin boundary? Perform an experiment to find out." or "With the Laptop data …, what two extra data points could you add without changing the mean or the SD?"). --- _itns_ is using ESCI --- a special Excel programmed software --- for these kinds of inquiries. These exercises are great and are one of the outstanding features of _itns_ but lack connection to a modern statistical software.

2. **Learning and applying R:** These second types of exercises are tool dependent. One has to know how the R language works, what kind of commands, functions and packages one has to use. Because of an overwhelming complexitiy R is infamous for its steep learning curve. There is no guidance by menues but users have to write code lines and programme their statistical explorations and analysis. --- _itns_ is using some additional exploratory files for SPSS and R usage. As important information these files have, they provide not the same leven of "local experiments" as this is done with the ESCI software.

## Target group and learning outcomes

This interactive tutorial is primarily intended for people who work through itns and want to have more interactive exercises using R. No familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed, but some basic grasp of using computers is necessary.

The following learning outcomes provide information at the course level. As there are different levels in a curriculum (course, module/chapter lesson/section etc.) with their own learning outcomes, only 3-5 learning outcomes on each level is sufficent. In formulating the following outcomes I am applying the taxonomy by Anderson & Krathwohl (2001, 2002) which is an extended and revised edition of the original taxonomy by Bloom (1956).

  The following learning outcomes are my tentative approximation and has still to be confirmed by the book authors.

Having successfully completed the itns-bokk with this interactive course you will be able to:

+ explain the differences between the NHST (Null hypothesis significance testing) and the new statistics approach (effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis).
+ to follow the new statistical approach of estimation by using the R programme package.
+ manipulate and transform data with R to bring them in a format suitable for exploratory data analysis
+ create high quality data visualizations with the R package ggplot2
+ apply Open Science procedures in order to foster transparency and reproducibility to your research projects

## How to use this tutorial?

[Here I will explain the different display modes and required actions]

This interactive course is written in R Markdown and uses the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package in combination with the [`checkr`](https://github.com/dtkaplan/checkr). The source code can be inspected at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/petzi53/itns). 

I have written this tutorial to rebuild my own competences in statistics and at the same time to improve my R skills. As I am not an expert on both subject please help to improve this tutorial via pull requests (PR) at GitHub or [contact me](mailto:peter_baumgartner@me.com) for errors or other improvements.
