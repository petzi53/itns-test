## Table of contents

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> There are 6 sections available for free on the https://shinyapps.io server from RStudio. For more material one has to pay or to downlaod and install the open source version. There is the possibility to address via links separated interactive sections which could represent the different chapters of the _ITNS_ book.

## Integration of videos

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> It is possible to embed videos into this interactive tutorial. But the video must be published either in YouTube or in Vimeo. I have downloaded just one video from the Routledge website to test this funtionality. I am not sure if this is legally allowed.
</div>

## Research Steps Sequences?

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
   <strong>Info:</strong> The next exercise tries to use an ordering questions. Unfortunately there is no functionality in `learnr` to for reordering sentences for example via drag & drop. I tried it with a multiple choice question. - Try this question several times, wrong answers will you give a taylored feedback.
</div>

There is a common way how research proceeds. Try to figure out the order of the different research steps: 

1. Apply statistical analysis.
2. Design a study to collect data.
3. Ask a research question.
4. Draw conclusions.
5. Interpret the results.
6. Carry out the study and collect the data.

```{r research-steps}
question("What is the correct research sequence of the above research phases?",
  answer("1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5", message = "The is the wrong sequence I have provided in the text above this question. You have to find the correct order for these research steps."),
  answer("3, 6, 2, 1, 4, 5", message = "You cannot carry out a study before you have designed it."),
  answer("3, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5", correct = TRUE),
  answer("3, 2, 6, 1, 5, 4", message = "You have to draw conclusion before you interpret the results in a written report."),
  answer("3, 2, 6, 4, 1, 5", message = "You have to apply statistical analysis before you can draw conclusions."),
  answer("2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5", message = "You have at first generate a research question before you design an appropriate study to collect data to answer your question."),
  random_answer_order = TRUE,
  allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## Using text with embedded graphics

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> It is easy to present text with graphics as I have already demonstrated in the previous section of this demo. What follows is another example.
</div>

Here is the correct order with some details taken form the opinion poll example in the book:

1. **Ask a research question.** What’s the support for Proposition A in the population of people likely to vote?
2. **Design a study to collect data that can answer the question.** Design a poll that will ask a sample of intending voters about their support for Proposition A.
3. **Carry out the study and collect the data.** Choose a sample of intending voters and ask them about their support for the proposition.
4. **Apply statistical analysis to picture and describe the data, and provide a basis for drawing conclusions.** Calculate that 53% of people in the sample say they support the proposition. Use knowledge of the poll design, especially the size of the sample, to calculate from the data that the margin of error is 2%, and therefore the confidence interval extends from 51% to 55%. Prepare the following figure:

![](../images/opinion-poll.png)

5. **Draw conclusions about what the data tell us in answer to our original question.** We take the 53% as the best estimate the data can give us of support in the population of likely voters, and the 2% margin of error as indicating the uncertainty in that estimate. In the figure, the dot marks the best estimate, and the confidence interval indicates the range of uncertainty.
6. **Interpret the results, give a critical discussion of the whole study, and prepare a report.** Think about the next study. Most likely, the true level of support among intending voters is within the interval from 51% to 55%, therefore the proposition is likely to be approved — although it may not be.



## Quizzes

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> There is a quiz tool integrated in the `learnr`-packages. At the moment there is no possibility to evaluate the quiz programmatically. It is mainly intended as a self determinded excercise. 
</div>

```{r quiz1-1}
quiz(caption = "Quiz Demo",
  question("A company is interested in how satisfied its customers are. To help find out, 50 customers are randomly selected to take part in a survey. Which of the following is true?",
    answer("The 50 customers surveyed are the sample, all the company’s customers are the
population.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Whatever result is found in the sample will be exactly the same in the population."),
    answer("The company would be better off sampling only 10 customers, 
           as this would produce less uncertainty about overall customer satisfaction."),
    answer("All of the answers in this question."),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("A confidence interval (CI) expresses…",
    answer("a range of plausible values for what is most likely true in the population."),
    answer("our uncertainty about what is true in the population."),
    answer("the fact that results from a sample may not perfectly reflect the population, due to sampling variability."),
    answer("all of the answers in this question.", correct = TRUE),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
    question("You read a poll result that says “62 ± 4% of likely voters support the referendum”. What is the ±4% part?",
    answer("This is the point estimate for referendum support."),
    answer("This is the population for referendum support."),
    answer("This is the margin of error (MoE).", correct = TRUE),
    answer("This is the sample size."),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
question("If the poll in the previous question was conducted well, which of these results would be most unlikely?",
    answer("The referendum passes with 66% support."),
    answer("The referendum passes with 63% support."),
    answer("The referendum passes with 61% support."),
    answer("The referendum passes with 55% support.", correct = TRUE),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)

```

## Pause, Reflect, and Discuss

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> In _ITNS_ there are many occasion where students are motivated to "pause, reflect, and discuss" the issues just explained and some question posed by the authors. This is meant to take notes by paper & pencil, so a digital version would only be a bad substitute. Especially as in the work of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) it turned out, that students on average remembered more after taking notes with pen than with laptop.

But digital note taking could be an additional ressource with its own value, e.g. to share and discuss it over the internet with the help of social media.  There is no R solution available. The best I came up with are links from the R tutorial to note taking apps.
</div>

My example is a link to [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/), which is not only a great app for note taking but has also great sharing functionality. To use the following example you need to download the free version. I have provided a public link which generates a copy of the note written by me. To work collaborativley one has to contact the author and to ask for a personal invation via eMail address. -- There are many note taking apps out there: See this [article](https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/applications/-best-note-taking-apps--3643394/) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eIVmaWNB4g) for some other examples.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px"
    src="../images/pause-reflect-discuss.png" alt="Logo for "pause, reflect and discuss">
Often in the text the student is asked to pause, reflect, and discuss intriguing issues. Research shows this is an effective learning technique, so we often ask students to write about a topic or discuss it with another student, to encourage critical thinking. These are also useful as prompts for class discussion or activities. 

[Click here for an example](https://www.evernote.com/l/ADR8ep4iUYFMS5YGnXSw6AAusWi9UPcmzRM)  to take an individual note to whatever topic you want.

## Pictures of a Data Set

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> This example finally demonstrate the interactive possibilities of this tutorial written with [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). In contrast to other interactive statistis programmes like [`Jamovi`](https://www.jamovi.org/) it is not limited by a predefined funtionality but can be programmed with whatever task or user interface in mind.

I will start here with a predefined set of data: The laptop transcription data from chapter three, which are visualized by two graphical representations: by a dotplot and a histogram at the same time. Learner can explore this different visualisation by manipulating the number of bins.
</div>


```{r laptop-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 20, max = 40, value = 31)
# laptop1 <- read_csv("Describe_Laptop.csv")
plotOutput("laptop1")
plotOutput("distPlot1")
textOutput("numBins")
```


```{r dotplot-Describe-Laptop, context="server"}

# output$numBins <- renderText({
#     x <- laptop$`Transcription%`
#     bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
#     binsDiff <- bins[2] - bins[1]
#     input$bins
# })

output$laptop1 <- renderPlot({
#    x <- laptop$`Transcription%`
    x <- laptop
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    binsDiff <- bins[2] - bins[1]
    if (input$bins >= 30) {
        factor = 0.1
    } else {
        factor = -0.001
    }
    ggplot(df_laptop, aes(x = `Transcription%`)) +
    geom_dotplot(binwidth = binsDiff, fill="red", color="black", 
                 dotsize = 1 + ((input$bins - 30) * factor))  +
        labs(
            title = "Figure 3.1: A stacked dot plot of the verbatim transcription data, in percent for the Laptop group,
            with N = 31, from Study 1 of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014)",
            x = "X (Transcription %)",
            y = NULL
            ) +
        coord_fixed(ratio = 12, expand = TRUE, clip = "on") +
        my_theme +
        theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
              panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
              # plot.margin = unit(c(-2, 0, -2, 0), "cm"),
              plot.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, 1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
        geom_rug()
})

output$distPlot1 <- renderPlot({
#    x <- laptop$`Transcription%`
    x <- laptop
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'steelblue', border = 'black',
         main = "Histogram of Transcription %",
         xlab = "Transcription %")
})
```

## Manipulating data

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> What follows is a very simple demonstration of data manipulation. Depending of the educational task you can elaborate these kind of exercises and write checker-function to test if the answer was correct and to give adequate and specific feedback. The following two exercises so not have these more complex funtionality.
</div>

```{r laod-laptop-data}
# lap <- laptop$`Transcription%`
lap <- laptop
```


### Displaying data

The laptop data set is already loaded into memory under the variable name `lap`. The command to display the first 5 data is already typed in and program is run. Play around and try to find out how many data the laptop set contains.

```{r display-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, exercise.setup="load-laptop-data"}
head(lap, 5)
```

```{r display-data-solution}
lap # just type the variable name to spit out all the data of the vector
# you could also try `head(lap, 1000)`
```

### Selecting data

R stores the laptop data internally as a vector. The next example shows you how to select a specific part of the laptop data. Try to find out how you could display the fifth to the seventh data point.

```{r select-laptop-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="load-laptop-data"}
lap[5]
```



```{r select-laptop-data-hint-1}
# Use the colon between start and end index of the vector
```

```{r select-laptop-data-hint-2}
lap[startIndex:endIndex]
```

```{r select-laptop-data-hint-3}
lap[5:7] # this is the solution
```

## Explore frequency distributions

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info:</strong> This is another somewhat more complex example I developed for another purpose. It is not directly related to the _ITNS_ books but shows some possibilities of calculating different measures of frequency distribution generated by randomized numbers.
</div>

```{r create-distributions, context="data"}
n = 10000
shape1 = 5
shape2 = 2
set.seed(1234) # tested also with 1111
d.normal <- rbeta(n, shape1, shape1)
d.right <-  rbeta(n, shape2, shape1)
d.left <-   rbeta(n, shape1, shape2)
``` 


```{r my-dist-ui1, context="render"}
    fluidRow(
        column(3,
            radioButtons("type", "Choose a distribution:",
                           c("Normal" = "norm",
                             "Right-skewed" = "right",
                             "Left-skewed" = "left")
                        ),
            checkboxInput("newDist", "Create a new distribution?", FALSE)
            ),
        column(9, htmlOutput("distText"))
    ) # end of fluidRow
    fluidRow(
        column(8,
              plotOutput("distPlot")
              )
)





```



```{r my-dist-server1,  context="server"}

explainNormal <- "The <b>normal distribution</b> is the most important and most widely used distribution in statistics. It is sometimes called the <i>bell curve</i> or <i>Gaussian curve</i>. Examples are: Height of people, blood pressure, points on a test.
<br />
Some features you can see here: 
<ul>
<li>The curve is symmetric at the center.</li>
<li>The curve is denser in the center and less dense in the tails.</li>
<li>The mean, mode and median are all equal.</li>
</ul>"

    
explainRight  <- "This is a <b>right-skewed distribution</b>, also called a positevely skewed distribution. This naming schema could be confusing (it was at least for me!) as you have to draw the name from the tail (and not from the peak) of the distribution. Here the longer tail is on the right resp. positive side, therefore it is a right-skewed or positevely skewed distribution.</br>

Another important issue to remember this naming schema: On this type of distribution is the mean always situated more on the right resp. positive side of mode and median."
