# ITNS Demo

With this short demo I want to explore possible interactive szenarios for a new edition of [Introduction to the New Statistics: Estimation, Open Science, and Beyond](https://www.routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138825529/default.php) by Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jageman (2017, New York: Routledge) or for short _ITNS_. It is a follow up of the discussion in the  [ITNS-blog](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/2018/10/09/itns-the-second-edition/#comment-99).

At the moment there are just two tiny chapters:

An [introduction about the purpose of the demo program](https://pbaumgartner.shinyapps.io/itns-00/) and [some interactive examples](https://pbaumgartner.shinyapps.io/itns-01/) to demonstrate the capabilities of the `learnr` package.
